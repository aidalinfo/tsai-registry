# Contributing to tsai-registry

Want to contribute your own agent to the registry? This guide will walk you through the process of adding a new agent to the community library.

## Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you have:
- A working Mastra agent that you want to share
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript and Mastra framework
- A GitHub account for submitting pull requests

## How to Add an Agent

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/aidalinfo/tsai-registry.git
cd tsai-registry
```

### 2. Create Your Agent Structure

Navigate to the `app/src/mastra/registry/agents/` directory and create a new folder for your agent:

```bash
mkdir app/src/mastra/registry/agents/your-agent-name
cd app/src/mastra/registry/agents/your-agent-name
```

### 3. Implement Your Agent

Create the required files for your agent. Here's the standard structure based on existing agents:

#### Main Agent File (`your-agent.ts`)

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Memory } from '@mastra/memory';
import { LibSQLStore } from '@mastra/libsql';

// Initialize model
const mainModel = openai("gpt-4o-mini");

export const yourAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Your Agent Name",
  instructions: `
    Detailed instructions for your agent.
    Explain what the agent does, how it behaves, and any specific guidelines.
  `,
  memory: new Memory({
    storage: new LibSQLStore({
      url: 'file:../mastra.db',
    }),
  }),
  model: mainModel,
  tools: {
    // Add your tools here
  }
});
```

#### Export File (`index.ts`)

```typescript
import { yourAgent } from './your-agent'

export { yourAgent }
```

### 4. Example: Looking at Existing Agents

Let's look at how the exa-agent is structured for reference:

**File Structure:**
```
app/src/mastra/registry/agents/exa-agent/
├── index.ts              # Export file
└── web-agent.ts          # Main agent implementation
```

**Key Features of the exa-agent:**
- Uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) for web search capabilities
- Requires `EXA_API_KEY` environment variable
- Specialized in web research with specific search strategies
- Includes retry logic and result evaluation

### 5. Test Your Agent

Before submitting, test your agent locally:

```bash
cd app
npm install
# Test your agent implementation
```

### 6. Submit a Pull Request

1. **Commit your changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your-agent-name"
git push origin main
```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title describing your agent
   - Description of what the agent does
   - Any special setup requirements
   - Screenshots or examples if applicable

### 7. Registry Build Process

Once your PR is approved and merged:
1. The maintainers will update the registry configuration using the CLI
2. Your agent will be built and added to the CLI registry
3. Users can then install it with `npx tsai-registry add your-agent-name`
   after running `npx tsai-registry init` to set their local registry folder.

## Best Practices

### Agent Design
- **Clear Purpose**: Make sure your agent has a specific, well-defined role
- **Good Instructions**: Write detailed instructions that guide the agent's behavior
- **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling and fallback strategies
- **Memory Usage**: Use memory appropriately for context retention

### Code Quality
- **TypeScript**: Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- **Dependencies**: Only include necessary dependencies
- **Environment Variables**: Clearly document any required API keys or configuration
- **Comments**: Add helpful comments to explain complex logic

### Documentation
- **README**: Consider adding a README.md in your agent folder
- **Examples**: Provide usage examples in your PR description
- **API Keys**: Document how to obtain necessary API keys

## Agent Ideas

Looking for inspiration? Here are some agent ideas the community would love to see:

- **Email Agent**: Automated email management and responses
- **Social Media Agent**: Content creation and scheduling
- **Code Review Agent**: Automated code analysis and suggestions
- **Data Analysis Agent**: CSV/JSON data processing and insights
- **Translation Agent**: Multi-language translation and localization
- **Image Generation Agent**: AI-powered image creation
- **Calendar Agent**: Meeting scheduling and calendar management

## Getting Help

Need help with your contribution? Here are some resources:

- **GitHub Issues**: Ask questions in the repository issues
- **Mastra Documentation**: Check the official Mastra docs
- **Community**: Join discussions in the project's community channels
- **Examples**: Study existing agents in the `app/src/mastra/registry/agents/` directory

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
- Use consistent indentation and formatting
- Include proper error handling
- Write clear, descriptive variable and function names

### Commit Messages
Use conventional commit format:
- `feat: add new agent for X functionality`
- `fix: resolve issue with Y agent`
- `docs: update agent documentation`

### Pull Request Process
1. Ensure your code follows the project standards
2. Test your agent thoroughly
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Respond to review feedback promptly

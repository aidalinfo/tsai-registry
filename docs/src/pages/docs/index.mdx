# tsai-registry

Welcome to **tsai-registry**, an open-source library of pre-built agents, tools, and workflows for Mastra framework.

## 🎯 What is tsai-registry?

tsai-registry is a comprehensive collection of ready-to-use Mastra components designed to accelerate AI application development. It serves as a centralized repository where developers can discover, use, and contribute high-quality agents and tools.

## 🚀 Why was it created?

The AI development ecosystem often suffers from fragmentation and repetitive work. Developers frequently rebuild the same agents and tools across different projects. tsai-registry was created to:

- **Eliminate duplication** - Provide battle-tested components instead of starting from scratch
- **Accelerate development** - Get productive immediately with pre-configured agents
- **Foster collaboration** - Enable the community to share and improve components together
- **Ensure quality** - Maintain consistent standards across all components

## 🛠️ Core Capabilities

### Agent Library
Access our growing collection of specialized agents:
- **Weather Agent** - Real-time weather data and forecasts
- **Exa Agent** - Advanced web search capabilities
- **Firecrawl Agent** - Intelligent web scraping

### Tool Collection
*Coming soon* - Reusable tools for common tasks

### Workflow Templates
*Coming soon* - Complete workflows for complex scenarios

## 🚧 Current Status

**tsai-registry is currently in active development!**

At this stage, we have 3 working agents available, but this is just the beginning. The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive library through community contributions. We believe that by sharing our agents and tools, we can create a valuable resource for the entire Mastra ecosystem.

### What's Available Now:
- ✅ 3 production-ready agents (Weather, Exa, Firecrawl)
- ✅ CLI for easy component management
- ✅ Full source code access

### What's Coming:
- 🔄 Tool collection
- 🔄 Workflow templates
- 🔄 More community-contributed agents

## 🔧 How it works

### Initialize the CLI
Run `npx tsai-registry init` once in your project. The command creates a
`settings-registry.json` file storing the local folder where components will be
copied. It asks for this path (default `src/mastra/registry`) and confirms if an
existing file should be overwritten.

```bash
npx tsai-registry init
```

### 1. Browse & Discover
Explore the registry to find components that match your needs:

```bash
# List all available components
npx tsai-registry list

# List specific component types
npx tsai-registry list agents
```

### 2. Download Locally
Pull the source files directly into your project:

```bash
# Add a specific agent to your project
npx tsai-registry add weather-agent

# Add other components
npx tsai-registry add exa-agent
npx tsai-registry add firecrawl-agent
```

### 3. Customize & Extend
All components come with full source code, allowing you to:
- Modify behavior to fit your specific requirements
- Add new features and capabilities
- Integrate with your existing systems
- Maintain full control over your implementation

### 4. Share & Contribute
Built something useful? Share it back with the community by contributing to the repository.

## 🌟 Key Benefits

- **Local Control** - All files are downloaded locally, giving you complete ownership
- **Full Customization** - Modify any aspect of the components to match your needs
- **Community Driven** - Benefit from collective knowledge and continuous improvements
- **Production Ready** - Components are tested and used in real-world applications
- **Easy Integration** - Seamlessly works with existing Mastra projects

## 🏗️ Architecture

The registry is organized into distinct categories:

- **`/agents`** - Autonomous AI agents for specific tasks *(currently available)*
- **`/tools`** - Reusable utility functions and integrations *(coming soon)*
- **`/workflows`** - Complex multi-step processes *(coming soon)*

Each component includes:
- Complete source code
- Configuration examples
- Documentation
- Type definitions
- Automatic dependency installation

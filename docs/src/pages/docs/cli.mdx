# tsai-registry CLI

This page describes the available commands of the `tsai-registry` CLI and how they rely on the `settings.json` file.

## General usage

Run commands with `npx`:

```bash
npx tsai-registry <command>
```

## Available commands

### `init`

Create a local `settings-registry.json` file. This file overrides
`settings.local` from `settings.json` and indicates where downloaded components
should be stored. The command asks for the local registry path (default
`src/mastra/registry`) and, if the file already exists, whether to overwrite it.

```bash
npx tsai-registry init
```

### `settings`

Display the configuration used by the CLI:

```bash
npx tsai-registry settings
```

The configuration is loaded with the `loadSettings` function from `cli/utils.ts`.

### `list [type]`

List objects from the registry. The optional `type` can be `agents`, `workflows`, `tools` or `mcp`.

```bash
npx tsai-registry list agents
```

The CLI reads the registry path from `settings.json`, loads `registry.json` and displays the matching entries.

### `add <name>`

Copy an agent, workflow or tool from the registry locally. The command downloads the files listed in `registry.json`, installs the required dependencies and prints environment variables to add.

```bash
npx tsai-registry add weather-agent
```

The destination folder is defined by `settings.local` in `settings.json`. If the folder already exists, the CLI asks whether to overwrite it.

### `build [registryPath]`

Generate a `registry.json` file from a local folder containing your agents. The default path is `app/src/mastra/registry`, but you can provide a custom one:

```bash
npx tsai-registry build ./my-agents
```
The command iterates through the `agents`, `workflows` and `tools` subfolders and gathers the files needed for each entry. It detects the AI providers used in the source files and stores them in the `aiprovider` array. It also ignores extensions listed in `build.ignoreExtensions` from `settings.json`.

## `settings.json`

The `settings.json` file centralises the CLI configuration. Example:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "url": "https://github.com/aidalinfo/tsai-registry",
    "registry": "registry.json",
    "local": "src/mastra/registry"
  },
  "build": {
    "ignoreExtensions": [
      ".md",
      ".yaml"
    ]
  }
}
```

- **settings.url**: URL of the default registry repository.
- **settings.registry**: path to the `registry.json` file to load.
- **settings.local**: folder where objects added with the `add` command are copied.
- **build.ignoreExtensions**: file extensions ignored when generating the registry with `build`.

You can set the `TSAR_SETTINGS_URL` environment variable to override the official settings URL. This lets you point the CLI to a different registry repository. If no flag or variable is provided, the CLI falls back to the default URL declared in `cli/utils.ts`.
